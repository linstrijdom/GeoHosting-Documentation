# First Log In & Setting Your Password

## Accessing pgAdmin

To begin using your hosted database, go to the <span class="ui-page-label">Hosted Products</span> section of the GSH Dashboard. From there, click the <span class="ui-generic-label">Product Name</span> you selected during setup.

You can also access pgAdmin directly using the unique URL, which is listed on the <span class="ui-page-label">Product Details</span> page in the dashboard.

## Logging In

To begin working with your hosted database, log in to pgAdmin using the credentials you retrieved from the GSH Dashboard.

On the pgAdmin <span class="ui-page-label">Login</span> page, enter your **Username** (your registered email address) and **Password** (copied from the GSH Dashboard), then click <span class="ui-generic-label">Login</span> to continue.

<br>

Once logged in, the pgAdmin interface displays a clean workspace consisting of three main areas:

- The **Menu Bar** at the top
- The **Object Explorer** tree on the left
- The **Tabbed Browser** on the right

## Changing Your Password

After your first login, it’s highly recommended to update your default password to keep your database secure.

1. Click the <span class="ui-generic-label">User</span> button in the upper-right corner of the pgAdmin interface.

2. From the dropdown menu, select <span class="ui-generic-label">Change Password</span>.

3. Enter your **current password**, then type your **new password** and re-enter it to confirm.

4. Click <span class="ui-generic-label">Change</span> to save your updated password.
