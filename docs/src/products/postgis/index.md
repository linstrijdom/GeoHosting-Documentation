# PostGIS

## What is PostGIS?

**PostGIS** is an open-source spatial database extender for the **PostgreSQL** object-relational database. Your hosted PostGIS product comes fully managed and ready to use, allowing you to store, query, and analyze geographic data without worrying about installation or server setup.

<br>

When you purchase a hosted PostGIS instance, you get **PostgreSQL**, **PostGIS**, and **pgAdmin**, all preconfigured and managed for you. This setup provides a complete cloud-based spatial database environment out of the box, letting you focus on your data and analysis instead of infrastructure.

By combining the power of SQL with spatial capabilities, this hosted PostGIS product lets GIS professionals and developers perform advanced spatial analysis at scale, integrate with tools like **QGIS**, and centralize both spatial and non-spatial data in one secure, cloud-based database.

<br>

## Core Capabilities

- **Spatial Data Storage**

    Store and manage vector (points, lines, polygons) and raster data directly in PostgreSQL

- **Spatial Indexing**

    Uses specialized indexes to enable fast spatial searches and queries based on location.

- **Spatial Functions**

    Perform geometric and geographic calculations using hundreds of built-in functions.

- **Raster Analysis**

    Analyze, process, and mosaic raster datasets directly in the database.

- **Topology & Routing**

    Extend PostGIS with add-ons like pgRouting for advanced network and topology operations.

<br>

## pgAdmin 4

**pgAdmin 4** is included with your hosted PostGIS product, providing a modern graphical interface to manage your database with ease.

It eliminates the need to connect via command line, offering an accessible web-based environment for all common database operations.
