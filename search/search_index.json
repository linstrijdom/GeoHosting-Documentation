Checklists from the SANParks BIMS should not be accepted at face value. The information that is used to produce the checklists has not been vetted and it is likely to have some errors in it. For example, users of iNaturalist and Observation.org may have selected an incorrect scientific name for an animal they have seen. Different sources, particularly citizen science platforms, can use scientific names of different taxonomic rank (species and subspecies) when referring to the same taxon, which in this case, is an animal with the same common name. This is not a problem when one scientific name is a synonym of the other, as the issue will be resolved through the use of the Accepted name. It is a problem when both the subspecies and species names are accepted but they are being used to refer to the same taxon (same common name).</p> <p>To finalise a checklist, the <code>incorrect</code> or redundant name can be removed and the source for the additional, redundant name can be shifted to the \u201ccorrect\u201d name. If you are unsure which name to use, then consider the sources and number of sources and occurrence records for the two names. Another rule of thumb that can be used, is where a common name refers to a species, then use the scientific name for the species name, as opposed to where a common name, such as blesbok, refers to a subspecies, where the scientific name for the subspecies should be used. The online version of Wilson and Reeder\u2019s Mammals of the World provides a useful resource for information on mammals.</p> <p>Another issue arises where the wrong subspecies has been named for a park e.g. confusing blue and black wildebeest or Mountain zebra and Burchell\u2019s zebra. There shouldn\u2019t be two subspecies co-occurring in a park, and where there are two subspecies, the one with the most sources and observations is likely to be correct. In all cases, the historical distribution range of one mammal subspecies will include the park, and that is the species that should be on the list.</p> <p>Below are some examples of redundant and incorrect names that appear on mammal checklists from the SANParks BIMS.</p> Incorrect Name Correct Name Common Name Notes Antidorcas marsupialis marsupialis Antidorcas marsupialis (Zimmermann, 1780) Springbok Subspecies name only used on citizen science platforms Caracal caracal caracal Caracal caracal (Schreber, 1776) Caracal Subspecies name only used on citizen science platforms Chlorocebus pygerythrus pygerythrus Chlorocebus pygerythrus (F.Cuvier, 1821) Vervet monkey Subspecies name only used on citizen science platforms Connochaetes taurinus (Burchell, 1823) Connochaetes gnou (Zimmermann, 1780) Black wildebeest One record of incorrect subspecies (Blue wildebeest) on citizen science platform.

Layer names with special or non-standard characters (e.g., em dashes, smart quotes) can cause errors.        Fix: Use only standard ASCII characters like regular hyphens (-), letters, and numbers.    Why are duplicate layers created when pushing from QGIS?      Pushing edits from the original QGIS layer again after pushing creates duplicates.        Fix: Close the original QGIS layer after pushing, then fetch the layer from GeoNode and edit that to avoid duplicates.    My uploaded layer doesn\u2019t show up in GeoNode \u2014 what\u2019s wrong?      It might be an import error or file format issue. Check if your file is zipped properly and in a supported format like Shapefile or GeoPackage. Also, verify upload logs for errors.    I get an error about geometry types when uploading a layer, how to fix it?      GeoNode expects consistent geometry types. For example, a \"LineString\" layer should not contain \"MultiLineString\" features.        Fix: Use QGIS\u2019s \"Multipart to Singleparts\" tool or similar to ensure geometries are consistent before upload.    Why can\u2019t I see certain layers or maps on the public site?      The layer or map might be private or restricted. Check the \u201cSharing\u201d permissions and ensure the \"Anonymous Users\" group has view rights if you want public access.    I uploaded a zipped shapefile, but it\u2019s missing attributes \u2014 why?      Make sure all required components of the shapefile (.shp, .shx, .dbf, .prj) are included in the ZIP file. If even one is missing, GeoNode may not import it correctly.    My layer appears blank in the map viewer \u2014 what\u2019s wrong?      Your layer might be outside the current map extent or missing a coordinate reference system (CRS).        Fix: Check your layer in QGIS, reproject it to EPSG:4326 if needed, and re-upload.    Upload fails with a \"timeout\" or \"server error\"      Large files can cause timeouts or memory issues. Try simplifying geometries or reducing file size. If the problem persists, contact your GeoNode administrator for upload limits or server logs.    Styling changes in the map viewer aren\u2019t saving      After applying style changes, make sure you click the **Save** button in the map composer. Also confirm you have edit permissions for the map or layer.    I can\u2019t upload a layer due to a \u201cduplicate name\u201d error      GeoNode does not allow two layers with the same name. Rename your layer in QGIS or during the upload process to ensure it\u2019s unique."},{"location":"products/geonode/help/#frequently-asked-questions-faq","title":"Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)","text":"Can I upgrade my product or plan?      Not yet. At the moment, upgrading from one product tier to another is not supported. However, this feature is actively being worked on and will be available in a future release. Stay tuned!    Can I use a custom domain name for my GeoNode instance?      Currently, custom domains are not supported. This is a frequently requested feature and is already on the roadmap. We\u2019re working to make this available in an upcoming version.    How do I update an existing layer on GeoNode via QGIS?      Fetch the existing layer from GeoNode using the plugin, make your edits on this fetched layer, then push your changes back to GeoNode to update without creating duplicates.    What file formats can I upload to GeoNode?      GeoNode supports zipped Shapefiles, GeoPackages, and CSVs with geometry columns. Ensure your data matches one of these for successful uploads.    How do I set permissions for my layers and maps?      After uploading, use the \u201cSharing\u201d tab to assign view and edit permissions to users or groups. This controls who can access or modify your content.    Can I create maps combining multiple layers?      Yes! You can create composite maps by adding multiple layers in the GeoNode map viewer. Save your map to share or publish it.    How can I delete a layer or map from GeoNode?      Navigate to the layer or map\u2019s detail page, click on the \u201cDelete\u201d button (if you have permissions), and confirm the deletion. Note this action is permanent.    How do I change the coordinate system of a layer?      Use QGIS to reproject the layer to a standard CRS like EPSG:4326 before uploading. GeoNode relies on consistent spatial references for accurate display and analysis.    Can I collaborate with teammates on a shared map?      Yes. Set map and layer permissions to allow viewing or editing by specific users or groups. Use the \"Sharing\" tab on each resource\u2019s page to configure access.    Can I attach documents or metadata to a layer?      Yes, you can add rich metadata including descriptions, keywords, licensing, and even external documents using the Metadata tab on the layer page."},{"location":"products/geonode/help/#getting-support","title":"Getting Support","text":"<p>If you run into an issue or need assistance, the best place to start is the Support Centre section on the  Users page.</p> <p>There, you\u2019ll find clear instructions on how to log a support ticket, including what information to provide so the team can assist you efficiently.</p> <p>By using the official support system, your request will be properly tracked and routed to the right people, helping you get a faster and more accurate response.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"products/geonode/overview/","title":"Documentation","text":""},{"location":"products/geonode/overview/#geonode-overview","title":"GeoNode Overview","text":""},{"location":"products/geonode/overview/#why-choose-this-product","title":"Why Choose this Product?","text":"<p>GeoNode is a ready-to-use Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) platform designed to help organizations effortlessly share, visualize, and collaborate on geospatial data\u2014eliminating the need to build complex systems from scratch.

This can happen if the file format isn\u2019t supported or the file is too large.        Fix: Use supported formats like Shapefile, GeoPackage, or GeoTIFF. For Shapefiles, ensure all related files (.shp, .shx, .dbf, .prj) are zipped together.    My layer appears but it\u2019s blank \u2014 why?      Your data\u2019s projection (CRS) may not match your map settings.        Fix: Check the layer\u2019s CRS in QGIS or another GIS tool, and set the correct SRS in GeoServer when publishing.    I get an error when trying to save a style (SLD).      Errors often come from invalid XML or unsupported style parameters.        Fix: Validate your SLD using an XML validator or copy a working example and modify it carefully.    Why is my raster layer loading slowly?      Large raster files can take time to render.        Fix: Use overviews or pyramids, and ensure the file is in an efficient format like GeoTIFF with internal tiling.    I published my layer but can\u2019t preview it.      The preview may fail if no style is assigned or if the layer is in a different workspace.        Fix: Assign a default style and check the workspace and store settings.    Why do I see a \u201cStore not found\u201d error?      This happens if the data store was deleted or its connection settings changed.        Fix: Recreate the store and republish the layer with the correct settings.    The colors in my map look wrong.      This can be caused by incorrect SLD values or mismatched color encoding.        Fix: Double-check your SLD code and ensure the correct hex color codes are used.    Why do some features not appear on the map?      Features outside the map extent or with geometry errors may not render.        Fix: Repair geometries in QGIS and verify the bounding box settings in GeoServer.    I can\u2019t delete a layer from GeoServer.      Layers must be removed from both the Layer list and their Data Store.        Fix: First delete the layer, then remove its store and associated files.    GeoServer says \u201cOut of Memory\u201d when rendering.      Large datasets can exceed the Java heap memory allocation.        Fix: Increase the Java heap size in the GeoServer startup settings or optimize your dataset."},{"location":"products/geoserver/help/#frequently-asked-questions-faq","title":"Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)","text":"Can I upload multiple layers at once?      Yes. You can zip multiple Shapefiles or upload multi-layer GeoPackages, and publish them individually in GeoServer.    What file formats does GeoServer support?      Common formats include Shapefile, GeoPackage, PostGIS, GeoTIFF, and CSV. Additional formats may be available through plugins.    Can I edit a layer directly in GeoServer?      No. GeoServer serves data but does not allow direct editing. Edit your data in QGIS or another GIS tool, then re-upload or update the store.    How do I change the default style of a layer?      Go to the layer\u2019s Publishing tab, select your preferred style, and set it as default.    Can I password-protect certain layers?      Yes. Use GeoServer\u2019s security settings to assign roles and restrict layer access.    Does GeoServer support WMS, WFS, and WCS?      Yes. GeoServer supports OGC standards including WMS (maps), WFS (features), and WCS (coverages).    How can I speed up layer loading?      Use caching with GeoWebCache, simplify geometries, and optimize file formats.    Can I host my data in the cloud?      Yes. You can connect GeoServer to cloud storage or cloud-hosted databases like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or remote PostGIS.    Can I host raster data in GeoServer?      Yes, GeoServer supports raster formats such as GeoTIFF, JPEG2000, and others.    What\u2019s the maximum file size I can upload?      This depends on your hosting plan and server configuration.        Tip: If you encounter upload limits, compress your dataset (e.g., using a zipped Shapefile or GeoPackage) or contact your administrator to increase the limit."},{"location":"products/geoserver/help/#getting-support","title":"Getting Support","text":"<p>If you run into an issue or need assistance, the best place to start is the Support Centre section on the  Users page.</p> <p>There, you\u2019ll find clear instructions on how to log a support ticket, including what information to provide so the team can assist you efficiently.</p> <p>By using the official support system, your request will be properly tracked and routed to the right people, helping you get a faster and more accurate response.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"products/geoserver/overview/","title":"Documentation","text":""},{"location":"products/geoserver/overview/#geoserver-overview","title":"GeoServer Overview","text":""},{"location":"products/geoserver/overview/#why-choose-this-product","title":"Why Choose this Product?","text":"<p>GeoServer is a powerful and widely adopted open-source server platform for sharing geospatial data.
