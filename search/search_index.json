Checklists from the SANParks BIMS should not be accepted at face value. The information that is used to produce the checklists has not been vetted and it is likely to have some errors in it. For example, users of iNaturalist and Observation.org may have selected an incorrect scientific name for an animal they have seen. Different sources, particularly citizen science platforms, can use scientific names of different taxonomic rank (species and subspecies) when referring to the same taxon, which in this case, is an animal with the same common name. This is not a problem when one scientific name is a synonym of the other, as the issue will be resolved through the use of the Accepted name. It is a problem when both the subspecies and species names are accepted but they are being used to refer to the same taxon (same common name).</p> <p>To finalise a checklist, the <code>incorrect</code> or redundant name can be removed and the source for the additional, redundant name can be shifted to the \u201ccorrect\u201d name. If you are unsure which name to use, then consider the sources and number of sources and occurrence records for the two names. Another rule of thumb that can be used, is where a common name refers to a species, then use the scientific name for the species name, as opposed to where a common name, such as blesbok, refers to a subspecies, where the scientific name for the subspecies should be used. The online version of Wilson and Reeder\u2019s Mammals of the World provides a useful resource for information on mammals.</p> <p>Another issue arises where the wrong subspecies has been named for a park e.g. confusing blue and black wildebeest or Mountain zebra and Burchell\u2019s zebra. There shouldn\u2019t be two subspecies co-occurring in a park, and where there are two subspecies, the one with the most sources and observations is likely to be correct. In all cases, the historical distribution range of one mammal subspecies will include the park, and that is the species that should be on the list.</p> <p>Below are some examples of redundant and incorrect names that appear on mammal checklists from the SANParks BIMS.</p> Incorrect Name Correct Name Common Name Notes Antidorcas marsupialis marsupialis Antidorcas marsupialis (Zimmermann, 1780) Springbok Subspecies name only used on citizen science platforms Caracal caracal caracal Caracal caracal (Schreber, 1776) Caracal Subspecies name only used on citizen science platforms Chlorocebus pygerythrus pygerythrus Chlorocebus pygerythrus (F.Cuvier, 1821) Vervet monkey Subspecies name only used on citizen science platforms Connochaetes taurinus (Burchell, 1823) Connochaetes gnou (Zimmermann, 1780) Black wildebeest One record of incorrect subspecies (Blue wildebeest) on citizen science platform.

Your project might not be published or added to a Macro Group.        Fix: Make sure your QGIS project is published and assigned to an active Macro Group in the admin panel.    Why is the map blank or slow to load?      This could be due to missing base layers or unsupported CRS settings.        Fix: Ensure a valid base layer like OSM is set and your QGIS project is using the correct coordinate system.    My changes in QGIS are not reflected in G3W-SUITE      Updating the project file alone doesn't update the published version.        Fix: Re-publish the updated QGIS project and restart the G3W-SUITE services if needed.    The popup information doesn\u2019t display correctly      Field aliases or HTML formatting issues may cause this.        Fix: Use the QGIS \"Identify\" tool to verify field names and ensure the HTML popup template is well-formed.    I get an error when trying to save edits in the WebGIS      Your user role may not have editing permissions, or the database connection is misconfigured.        Fix: Check that your user role allows editing, and verify the editing settings in the admin interface.    Why aren\u2019t my symbology settings preserved?      G3W-SUITE supports most but not all QGIS symbology features.        Fix: Use simple categorized or rule-based styles, and avoid complex symbol layers.    My labels are missing or cut off      Label rendering may be affected by scale or layer settings.        Fix: Adjust label settings in QGIS to use scale-based visibility, and check layer order and priority.    Why can't I create a new Macro Group?      Only administrators can create Macro Groups.        Fix: Contact a G3W admin or ensure your user role has the correct permissions.    The base map doesn\u2019t appear in the viewer      This may be due to missing URL or projection mismatch.        Fix: Make sure the base map URL is valid and matches the WebGIS projection (EPSG:4326 recommended).    I get a \u201cproject not found\u201d error when trying to view a service      The QGIS project may not be published correctly or the path is wrong.

Yes. G3W-SUITE supports multiple database types including PostGIS. You can configure connections in the admin interface.    Does G3W-SUITE support editing from the browser?      Yes. Editing tools can be activated for specific layers and user roles. Make sure you configure edit permissions correctly.    Can I use a custom domain for my G3W instance?      Yes, with the appropriate server configuration and domain settings. Contact your system administrator or hosting provider.    What\u2019s the best projection to use?      EPSG:4326 is recommended for compatibility with most web mapping tools and base maps.    Can I disable certain tools for some users?      Yes. Use the role-based configuration in the admin panel to control which widgets, tools, and services are available per user group.    Is it possible to embed the map in another website?      Yes. G3W-SUITE provides iframe embedding support for public WebGIS projects.    How do I localize the G3W interface?      G3W-SUITE supports multiple languages. You can set the default language per user or browser locale.    What file types can I use for vector layers?      QGIS supports a wide range of vector formats like Shapefile, GeoPackage, SpatiaLite, and PostGIS \u2014 all of which are compatible with G3W-SUITE.    Can I back up or export my WebGIS projects?      Not directly through the interface, but you can back up QGIS projects, database files, and G3W config manually from the server.    Is there an audit log or activity tracker?      G3W-SUITE includes basic logging features for some operations.

Layer names with special or non-standard characters (e.g., em dashes, smart quotes) can cause errors.        Fix: Use only standard ASCII characters like regular hyphens (-), letters, and numbers.    Why are duplicate layers created when pushing from QGIS?      Pushing edits from the original QGIS layer again after pushing creates duplicates.        Fix: Close the original QGIS layer after pushing, then fetch the layer from GeoNode and edit that to avoid duplicates.    My uploaded layer doesn\u2019t show up in GeoNode \u2014 what\u2019s wrong?      It might be an import error or file format issue. Check if your file is zipped properly and in a supported format like Shapefile or GeoPackage. Also, verify upload logs for errors.    I get an error about geometry types when uploading a layer, how to fix it?      GeoNode expects consistent geometry types. For example, a \"LineString\" layer should not contain \"MultiLineString\" features.        Fix: Use QGIS\u2019s \"Multipart to Singleparts\" tool or similar to ensure geometries are consistent before upload.    Why can\u2019t I see certain layers or maps on the public site?      The layer or map might be private or restricted. Check the \u201cSharing\u201d permissions and ensure the \"Anonymous Users\" group has view rights if you want public access.    I uploaded a zipped shapefile, but it\u2019s missing attributes \u2014 why?      Make sure all required components of the shapefile (.shp, .shx, .dbf, .prj) are included in the ZIP file. If even one is missing, GeoNode may not import it correctly.    My layer appears blank in the map viewer \u2014 what\u2019s wrong?      Your layer might be outside the current map extent or missing a coordinate reference system (CRS).        Fix: Check your layer in QGIS, reproject it to EPSG:4326 if needed, and re-upload.    Upload fails with a \"timeout\" or \"server error\"      Large files can cause timeouts or memory issues. Try simplifying geometries or reducing file size. If the problem persists, contact your GeoNode administrator for upload limits or server logs.    Styling changes in the map viewer aren\u2019t saving      After applying style changes, make sure you click the **Save** button in the map composer. Also confirm you have edit permissions for the map or layer.    I can\u2019t upload a layer due to a \u201cduplicate name\u201d error      GeoNode does not allow two layers with the same name. Rename your layer in QGIS or during the upload process to ensure it\u2019s unique."},{"location":"products/geonode/help/#frequently-asked-questions-faq","title":"Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)","text":"Can I upgrade my product or plan?      Not yet. At the moment, upgrading from one product tier to another is not supported. However, this feature is actively being worked on and will be available in a future release. Stay tuned!    Can I use a custom domain name for my GeoNode instance?      Currently, custom domains are not supported. This is a frequently requested feature and is already on the roadmap. We\u2019re working to make this available in an upcoming version.    How do I update an existing layer on GeoNode via QGIS?      Fetch the existing layer from GeoNode using the plugin, make your edits on this fetched layer, then push your changes back to GeoNode to update without creating duplicates.    What file formats can I upload to GeoNode?      GeoNode supports zipped Shapefiles, GeoPackages, and CSVs with geometry columns. Ensure your data matches one of these for successful uploads.    How do I set permissions for my layers and maps?      After uploading, use the \u201cSharing\u201d tab to assign view and edit permissions to users or groups. This controls who can access or modify your content.    Can I create maps combining multiple layers?      Yes! You can create composite maps by adding multiple layers in the GeoNode map viewer. Save your map to share or publish it.    How can I delete a layer or map from GeoNode?      Navigate to the layer or map\u2019s detail page, click on the \u201cDelete\u201d button (if you have permissions), and confirm the deletion. Note this action is permanent.    How do I change the coordinate system of a layer?      Use QGIS to reproject the layer to a standard CRS like EPSG:4326 before uploading. GeoNode relies on consistent spatial references for accurate display and analysis.    Can I collaborate with teammates on a shared map?      Yes. Set map and layer permissions to allow viewing or editing by specific users or groups. Use the \"Sharing\" tab on each resource\u2019s page to configure access.    Can I attach documents or metadata to a layer?      Yes, you can add rich metadata including descriptions, keywords, licensing, and even external documents using the Metadata tab on the layer page."},{"location":"products/geonode/help/#getting-support","title":"Getting Support","text":"<p>If you run into an issue or need assistance, the best place to start is the Support Centre section on the  Users page.</p> <p>There, you\u2019ll find clear instructions on how to log a support ticket, including what information to provide so the team can assist you efficiently.</p> <p>By using the official support system, your request will be properly tracked and routed to the right people, helping you get a faster and more accurate response.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"products/geonode/overview/","title":"Documentation","text":""},{"location":"products/geonode/overview/#geonode-overview","title":"GeoNode Overview","text":""},{"location":"products/geonode/overview/#why-choose-this-product","title":"Why Choose this Product?","text":"<p>GeoNode is a ready-to-use Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) platform designed to help organizations effortlessly share, visualize, and collaborate on geospatial data\u2014eliminating the need to build complex systems from scratch.

It also supports advocacy, partnership building, and resource mobilisation.</p>"},{"location":"products/geosight/#four-ways-to-use-geosight-and-ccri-drm-data","title":"Four Ways to Use GeoSight and CCRI-DRM Data","text":"<p>GeoSight\u2019s interoperability allows UNICEF country teams and partners to engage in information sharing through four key methods:</p> <ol> <li>UNICEF GeoSight Dashboard Instance</li> <li> <p>A country-specific dashboard, hosted on UNICEF servers, with full access to all features.</p> </li> <li> <p>External GeoSight Dashboard Instance</p> </li> <li> <p>As an open-source platform, anyone can install and customise a GeoSight instance on local servers at no cost.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data Sharing with External Platforms</p> </li> <li> <p>GeoSight can send data via API to other mapping platforms already in use.</p> </li> <li> <p>Embedding GeoSight Data</p> </li> <li>Users can copy and paste a URL to embed GeoSight visualisations in any website.</li> </ol> <p></p>"},{"location":"products/geosight/guide/","title":"Documentation","text":""},{"location":"products/geosight/guide/#geosight-guidethis-section-describes-the-key-steps-for-preparing-a-geosight-dashboard","title":"GeoSight GuideThis section describes the key steps for preparing a GeoSight dashboard","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Find existing or create a new reference boundary dataset in GeoRepo (e.g. world country boundaries or subnational boundaries for your country / region of interest)</p> </li> <li> <p>Find existing or create new Indicator(s) \u27a1\ufe0f e.g. Number of armed conflict events, level of malnutrition, number of children etc</p> </li> <li> <p>Import data for Indicator(s) \u27a1\ufe0f e.g. import one-time from Excel file, or add scheduled data harvesters (from SharePoint or API)</p> </li> <li> <p>Find existing or add new Context Layer(s) \u27a1\ufe0f e.g. Armed conflict events, location of schools / hospitals / UNICEF offices, areas of control etc</p> </li> <li> <p>Create a new Project \u27a1\ufe0f Add Indicators \u27a1\ufe0f Create Indicator Layers \u27a1\ufe0f Add Context Layers \u27a1\ufe0f Define Filters \u27a1\ufe0f Define Widgets \u27a1\ufe0f Share your Project</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"products/geosight/guide/#how-to-prepare-data-for-geosight","title":"How to prepare data for GeoSight?","text":"<p>In GeoSight users can import data from multiple sources:</p> <ul> <li>APIs (JSON)</li> <li>Excel files</li> <li>SharePoint Excel</li> <li>SDMX Data Warehouse (coming soon)</li> </ul> <p>The easiest way is to import data using standalone Excel file.Excel import supports two formats:</p> <ul> <li>LONG and</li> <li>WIDE</li> </ul> <p></p>"},{"location":"products/geosight/guide/#excel-long-format","title":"Excel LONG format","text":"<ul> <li>Can be used to import multiple indicators, geographies (e.g. districts) and dates in one go</li> <li>Required columns:</li> <li>GeographyCode \u2013 contains unique code for identifying a geographic entity (e.g. district).
